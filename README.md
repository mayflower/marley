# About #

MarLeY is a simple ini editor that we wrote, because there seemed to be nothing out there supporting UTF-8 and \n escapes in ini files.

It is written by **Mar**ia, **Mar**tin and **Le**nz for **Y**vonne - hence the name.

This project was created during our slacktime at Mayflower.

# TODO #

* make Joomla-Specific code optional (currently, " is converted to "\_QQ\_" and vice versa, and it allows only for uppercase keys with underscores)
* add some kind of i18n
